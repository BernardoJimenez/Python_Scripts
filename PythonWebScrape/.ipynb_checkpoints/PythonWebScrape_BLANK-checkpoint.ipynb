    "## Webscraping background\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is web scraping?\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping is the activity of automating retrieval of information\n",
    "from a web service designed for human interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Is web scraping legal? Is it ethical?\n",
    "\n",
    "It depends. If you have legal questions seek legal counsel. You can\n",
    "mitigate some ethical issues by building delays and restrictions into\n",
    "your web scraping program so as to avoid impacting the availability of\n",
    "the web service for other users or the cost of hosting the service for\n",
    "the service provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Web scraping approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "No two websites are identical --- websites are built for different purposes by different people\n",
    "and so have different underlying structures. Because they are heterogeneous, there is no single way to\n",
    "scrape a website. **The scraping approach therefore has to be tailored to each individual site.**\n",
    "Here are some commonly used approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use requests to extract information from structured JSON files\n",
    "2. Use requests to extract information from HTML\n",
    "3. Automate a browser to retrieve information from HTML\n",
    "\n",
    "Bear in mind that even once you've decided upon the best approach for a particular site,\n",
    "it will be necessary to modified that approach to suit your particular use-case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does the web work?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Components\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers connected to the web are called **clients** and **servers**. A simplified diagram of how they interact might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/client_server.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Clients** are the typical web user's internet-connected devices (for example, your computer connected to your Wi-Fi) and web-accessing software available on those devices (usually a web browser like Firefox or Chrome).\n",
    "* **Servers** are computers that store webpages, sites, or apps. When a client device wants to access a webpage, a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed in the user's web browser.\n",
    "* **HTTP** is a language for clients and servers to speak to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### So What Happens?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you type a web address into your browser:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The browser finds the address of the server that the website lives on.\n",
    "2. The browser sends an **HTTP request message** to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website to the client. \n",
    "3. If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a \"200 OK\" message, and then starts displaying the website in the browser."

       "   'textiledescription': 'Discover how celebrated American artist Winslow Homer’s work for the illustrated periodical _Harper’s Weekly_ helped shape his later career as a painter and watercolorist.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Civil War (1861–1865), American artist Winslow Homer (1836–1910) served as a correspondent for _Harper’s_. His sketches of soldiers, both in battle on the front lines and in quieter moments back at camp, were reproduced to accompany the journal’s accounts of the conflict. Homer worked for _Harper’s_ just as new technologies were making it possible to rapidly reproduce newsworthy images on a large scale. Working together with _Harper’s_ editors and engravers, he employed a range of pictorial strategies to reassure skeptical readers that his illustrations were not fabrications, but eyewitness observations “drawn on the spot.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile in the field as an artist-correspondent, Homer developed habits of seeing and pictorial strategies that informed his work in other media.

       "   'textiledescription': 'Japanese woodblock prints, with their sophisticated designs and bold planes of color, have long attracted viewers and inspired Western artists such as Vincent van Gogh and Mary Cassatt. These technically refined and aesthetically exciting prints were among the earliest works of Asian art acquired by the Harvard Art Museums, first entering the collections in 1910. Today the museums house approximately 5,000 single-sheet Japanese woodblock prints, and this exhibition introduces a selection of superlative impressions from this lively medium. The exhibition also seeks to highlight the individuals whose generosity has made it possible for generations of Harvard students to encounter and learn from these works.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exhibition features almost 50 works spanning the history of Japanese woodblock printing, from the 17th through 20th century; these include single-sheet prints, luxury _surimono_ prints, printed handscrolls, and printed books by renowned designers such as Suzuki Harunobu (1725–1770), pioneer of the full-color print; landscape specialist Utagawa Hiroshige (1797–1858); enigmatic designer Sharaku (active 1794–95), best known for “big head” (_ōkubi_) actor prints; Itō Jakuchū (1716–1800); and the ever-popular Katsushika Hokusai (1760–1849). Also included are modern “new print” (_shin hanga_) and “creative print” (_sōsaku hanga_) works by the leaders of these two 20th-century movements, as well as a selection of woodblock printing tools to enhance visitors’ understanding of the medium.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exhibition also marks the first public presentation of the museums’ newest acquisition in the area of Japanese prints, a contemporary work by Noriko Saitō (b. 1973).\\r\\n\\r\\nCurated by Quintana Heathman, former Curatorial Fellow in Japanese Art (2014–16); and Rachel Saunders, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Associate Curator of Asian Art, Harvard Art Museums.\\r\\n\\r\\nSupport for this exhibition was provided by Harvard University’s Edwin O.

Legendary prince Shōtoku Taishi (c. 574–622) is regarded as the founder of Buddhism in Japan. At two years old (one by the Western count), he was believed to have taken several steps forward, faced east, put his hands together, and praised the Buddha. A sacred relic, the eyeball of the Buddha, then appeared between his hands. The diminutive life-size sculpture—the oldest and finest of its kind—depicts that miraculous moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis striking sculpture is remarkable not only for its seemingly animated presence, but also for the cache of more than 70 objects contained within the hollow body cavity. Sealed inside a veritable time capsule for over 700 years, these objects—relic grains, sutras, miniature sculptures, and scraps of paper inscribed with personalized poems and prayers—were carefully removed in the early 20th century. One of the most important objects from the group, an extremely rare printed Lotus Sutra dating to the Southern Song period (c. 1160), was subsequently gifted to the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. Thanks to the generosity of the Library of Congress, this exhibition reunites the Sutra with the remaining ensemble for the first time in over 70 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso featured in the exhibition is the spectacular 14th-century painting _The Legendary Biography of Prince Shōtoku_, on loan from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The painting relates several miraculous incidents from the prince’s early life.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurated by Rachel Saunders, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Associate Curator of Asian Art, Harvard Art Museums.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis exhibition was made possible in part by the Robert H. Ellsworth Bequest to the Harvard Art Museums. Additional support was provided by Harvard University’s Edwin O.

       "   'textiledescription': 'This exhibition presents the room-sized wall relief \"_Constellations II_\":https://hvrd.art/o/56779 by Alsatian artist and poet Hans Arp (1886–1966); it is the work’s first public viewing in 15 years. Commissioned for the Harvard Graduate Center by Harvard architecture professor and Bauhaus founding director Walter Gropius, the relief’s 13 panels were first installed in 1950 on facing walls of a popular dining room in Harkness Commons (now the Caspersen Center). Arp described its biomorphic shapes as primal forms inspired by nature, a connection made clear in the title of the work, which evokes a grouping of stars in the night sky. _Constellations II_ inaugurated a new chapter in Arp’s postwar practice. It was his first large-scale, site-specific artwork and led to others, including a metal relief for the UNESCO headquarters in Paris. \\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1958, heavy use of the Harkness dining room had caused damage to the relief, prompting a new placement of the work above table height. Subsequent painting campaigns transformed the panels’ stained redwood finish to gray-blue, then to white, and back to natural. With the cooperation of Harvard Law School, which transferred the relief to the Harvard Art Museums in 2017, the Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies undertook a yearlong conservation initiative to restore the work to its original finish. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe presentation of _Constellations II_ coincides with \"_The Bauhaus and Harvard_\":https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/visit/exhibitions/5615/the-bauhaus-and-harvard, the museums’ Spring 2019 special exhibition mounted in conjunction with the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Bauhaus.

       "   'textiledescription': '_The Bauhaus and Harvard_ — mounted in conjunction with the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Bauhaus in Weimar, Germany — presents nearly 200 works by 74 artists, drawn almost entirely from the Busch-Reisinger Museum’s extensive Bauhaus collection. Founded in 1919 and closed just 14 years later, the Bauhaus was the 20th century’s most influential school of art, architecture, and design. Harvard University played host to the first Bauhaus exhibition in the United States in 1930, and went on to become an unofficial center for the Bauhaus in America when founding director Walter Gropius joined Harvard’s department of architecture in 1937. Today the Busch-Reisinger Museum houses the largest Bauhaus collection outside Germany, initiated and assembled through the efforts of Gropius and many former teachers and students who emigrated from Nazi Germany, including Anni and Josef Albers, Herbert Bayer, Lyonel Feininger, and László Moholy-Nagy. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe exhibition features rarely seen student exercises, iconic design objects, photography, textiles, typography, paintings, and archival materials. It explores the school’s pioneering approach to art education, the ways its workshops sought to revolutionize the experience of everyday life, the widespread influence of Bauhaus instruction in America, and Harvard’s own Graduate Center (1950), the first modernist building complex on campus, designed by Gropius’s firm The Architects Collaborative. A complementary exhibition installed in an adjacent gallery — \"_Hans Arp’s Constellations II_\":https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/visit/exhibitions/5755/hans-arps-constellations-ii — features one of the site-specific works commissioned for the Graduate Center. A publication inspired by _The Bauhaus and Harvard_ and its related programming is due out in March 2021. \\r\\n\\r\\nOrganized by the Harvard Art Museums. Curated by Laura Muir, Research Curator in the Division of Academic and Public Programs, Harvard Art Museums. \\r\\n\\r\\nSupport for this project is provided by endowed funds, including the Daimler Curatorship of the Busch-Reisinger Museum Fund, the Charles L. Kuhn Endowment Fund, and the Care of the Busch-Reisinger Museum Collection Fund. The publication is supported by the Harvard Art Museums Mellon Publication Funds, including the Carola B. Terwilliger Fund. In addition, exhibition related programming is made possible by the M. Victor Leventritt Fund, which was established through the generosity of the wife, children, and friends of the late M. Victor Leventritt, Harvard Class of 1935. Modern and contemporary art programs at the Harvard Art Museums are made possible in part by generous support from the Emily Rauh Pulitzer and Joseph Pulitzer, Jr., Fund for Modern and Contemporary Art. \\r\\n\\r\\nShare your experience: #Bauhaus100 #HarvardArtMuseums \\r\\n\\r\\n*Online Resources* \\r\\n\\r\\nA comprehensive \"digital resource\":https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/special-collections/the-bauhaus launched in 2016 provides access to the museums’ more than 32,000 Bauhaus-related objects and shares scholarship on the school’s extensive ties to Harvard and the Greater Boston area. \\r\\n\\r\\nLearn more about the exhibition in our series of \"videos on Vimeo\":https://vimeo.com/channels/1441937/page:1, including an introduction by Laura Muir, a recording of artist Judith Raum\\'s lecture-performance evoking the figure of Bauhaus weaver Otti Berger during the exhibition\\'s opening celebration, presentations from the symposium \"Bauhaus 100: Object Lessons from a Historic Collection,\" and more. \\r\\n\\r\\n*Related Exhibitions at Harvard and Beyond* \\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Hans Arp’s Constellations II_\":https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/visit/exhibitions/5755/hans-arps-constellations-ii\\r\\nFebruary 8, 2019–July 28, 2019\\r\\nUniversity Research Gallery, Harvard Art Museums \\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Judith Raum: Raveled Fabrics_\":https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/visit/exhibitions/5858/judith-raum-raveled-fabrics\\r\\nFebruary 7, 2019–March 17, 2019\\r\\nLightbox Gallery, Harvard Art Museums \\r\\n\\r\\n\"_The Bauhaus at Home and Abroad: Selections from the Papers of Walter Gropius, Lyonel Feininger, and Andor Weininger_\":https://library.harvard.edu/events/bauhaus-home-and-abroad\\r\\nJanuary 15–May 31, 2019\\r\\nAmy Lowell Room, Houghton Library, Harvard University \\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Creating Community: Harvard Law School and the Bauhaus_\":https://exhibits.law.harvard.edu/creating-community-harvard-law-school-and-bauhaus\\r\\nFebruary 4–August 16, 2019\\r\\nCaspersen Room, Langdell Hall, Harvard Law School \\r\\n\\r\\n\"_The Bauhaus Studio: Primary Materials and Secondary Sources_\":https://edportal.harvard.edu/event/exhibition-bauhaus-studio-primary-materials-and-secondary-sources?delta=0\\r\\nApril 6–May 5, 2019 \\r\\nHarvard Ed Portal \\r\\n\\r\\nThe \"Goethe-Institut Boston\":https://www.goethe.de/ins/us/en/kul/art/bhs.html is promoting Bauhaus centennial events at a range of New England institutions, including \"_Radical Geometries: Bauhaus Prints, 1919–33_\":https://www.mfa.org/exhibitions/radical-geometries on view February 9 to June 23, 2019, at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; and \"_Arresting Fragments: Object Photography at the Bauhaus_\":https://mitmuseum.mit.edu/bauhaus on display March 28 to September 1, 2019, at the MIT Museum.',\n",

       "     'description': 'Founded by architect Walter Gropius (1883–1969) in 1919, the Bauhaus was the 20th century’s most influential school of art, architecture, and design. After the school was shuttered under pressure from the Nazis in 1933, many Bauhaus artists brought their innovative practices and teaching methods to the United States. Gropius himself accepted a position at Harvard, where he would help establish a collection of Bauhaus material that has since grown to more than 30,000 objects—the largest such collection outside Germany. Harvard in turn became an unofficial center for the Bauhaus in America. Written by established and emerging voices in the field, the scholarship presented here expands on the special link between the two institutions, while highlighting understudied aspects of the Bauhaus, such as weaving, photography, and art made by women. Accompanied by beautiful illustrations—some of never-before-published objects—this book yields fascinating insights for Bauhaus devotees and design aficionados.\\u3000A full reproduction of the six-page catalogue produced by the Harvard Society for Contemporary Art for its 1930 exhibition—the first Bauhaus exhibition in the United States—is included at the back of the book. \\r\\n\\r\\nLaura Muir is Associate Director of Academic and Public Programs and the Louis Miller Thayer Research Curator at the Harvard Art Museums.\\r\\nWith contributions by Francesca G. Bewer, Annie Bourneuf, Katarina Burin, Madeline Corona, Susan D. Costello, Katherine Eremin, Laura A.

       "   'textiledescription': 'The Americas were a vital stage of transatlantic encounters in modern architecture. Mobility of ideas, peoples, and works established intellectual and material networks that constructed modern architecture as an international event. This exhibition explores the vibrant cosmopolitan architecture culture in Latin America during the interwar period, using original materials from archival collections at Harvard. Presented here are works by Argentinian architects Jorge Ferrari Hardoy and Juan Kurchan, who collaborated with Le Corbusier, and by German architect Franz Möller, who worked with Walter Gropius, both of whom were key propagandists of modern architecture.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1931, Möller opened the office Gropius-Moller Arquitectos in Buenos Aires. Among the firm’s projects was the Ciudad Balnearia de Chapadmalal, a private commission for a large-scale seaside resort, represented here by the clubhouse. This high-end leisure development contrasts with Gropius Standard—a one-story, low-cost house intended for young professional couples that could transform over time to meet the needs of a growing family. This system continued Gropius’s interests in prefabrication, which can be traced back to his Bauhaus years, but was adjusted to suit local building and climatic conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early 1940s, Ferrari Hardoy and Kurchan conceived of an apartment building on Virrey del Pino Street to showcase the possibilities of “city in the park” modern planning; they envisioned the project as a fragment of a future greater whole. The 10-story apartment block is set back on an urban lot, and an ample garden separates the building from the street. Three august carefully preserved eucalyptus trees were woven into the facade, fusing practical climatic considerations and formal aesthetic concerns. Both architects were engaged in the Plan Director, a master plan for the Argentinian capital that had been developed with Le Corbusier in Paris. Le Corbusier’s daring proposal for skyscrapers on the Rio de la Plata, which had sprung from his 1929 visit to Argentina, would have extended the city of the Pampas into the river. This key functional and symbolic node sets the development of the Plan Director into a multinode city linked by circulation arteries. After the war, working for the city government, Ferrari Hardoy and Kurchan refined the plan and vigorously endeavored to publicize and implement it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis installation’s related course is taught by Patricio del Real, Assistant Professor of the History of Art and Architecture, Harvard University.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe University Teaching Gallery serves faculty and students affiliated with Harvard’s Department of History of Art and Architecture. Semester-long installations are mounted here in conjunction with undergraduate and graduate courses, supporting instruction in the critical analysis of art and making unique selections from the museums’ collections available to all visitors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis installation is made possible in part by funding from the Department of History of Art and Architecture. Modern and contemporary art programs at the Harvard Art Museums are made possible in part by generous support from the Emily Rauh Pulitzer and Joseph Pulitzer, Jr., Fund for Modern and Contemporary Art.\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks to the Frances Loeb Library at the Harvard Graduate School of Design for generously loaning works from the library’s Jorge Ferrari Hardoy Archive.',\n",

       "   'textiledescription': 'In 1638, a work of silver known as \"_The Great Salt_\":https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/232296  arrived in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Owned by John Glover, who died during his passage across the Atlantic, the object transferred to Glover’s widow Elizabeth, who later married Henry Dunster, the first president of Harvard. _The Great Salt_ (on display in the silver cabinet on Level 2, \"Gallery 2340\":https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/visit/floor-plan/2/2340?gallery=2340) is one of seven pieces of historic Harvard silver. This shape-shifting container, designed to hold salt for the dining table at a time when the mineral was a rare and valuable commodity, is invested with centuries of prestige. Originally the charge of the most important person sitting at the table, _The Great Salt_ continued to be used throughout the 20th century as part of the regalia for inauguration ceremonies of new Harvard presidents.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis object was selected by Jace Clayton, a visiting artist at the Harvard Art Museums, as the subject for a digital response—a sonic extension and intervention into _The Great Salt_’s narrative. A display vitrine, much like those that protect precious objects elsewhere in the museums, here holds approximately 40 electronic synthesizer modules, connected with multicolored cables. Programmed using granular synthesis, a technique that breaks a sound into tiny “grains,” this collection of electronic components performs a new work—a composition designed by Clayton to self-modulate, actively generating new sounds and changing as it repeats. Three marímbulas—Afro-Cuban thumb pianos—surround the vitrine and can be played by visitors, affecting the presentation of the electronic sound.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe year 1638, just as _The Great Salt_ made its way to Massachusetts, was also when the first enslaved Africans arrived in the colony. This installation includes references to both 17th-century European and African musical forms, playing with associations between _The Great Salt_, the sea, and the Middle Passage. Through sound, the installation responds to _The Great Salt_ with acts of performance, translation, and participation.\\r\\n\\r\\nJace Clayton, Harvard College class of ’97, is an artist and writer based in New York City. Also known for his performances as DJ /rupture, Clayton creates interdisciplinary works that explore interactions among sound, memory, and public space. His sonic experiments have been exhibited at the Andy Warhol Museum and Barnes Foundation, and his works travel internationally in the form of music, writing, and frequent live performances. Clayton joined the faculty of Bard College in 2013 and recently served as the Nannerl Keohane Distinguished Visiting Professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Duke University. He has been an artist-in-residence with the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council and the Eyebeam Art + Technology Atelier, as well as a USC Annenberg/Getty Arts Journalism Fellow. He is the author of _Uproot: Travels in 21st-Century Music and Digital Culture_ (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2016).\\r\\n\\r\\n*Online Resources*\\r\\n\"Watch a performance\":https://vimeo.com/album/5633618 of _Salt Wood Salt Wire Salt Salt_, a new composition by Jace Clayton. This companion piece to the installation _Jace Clayton, The Great Salt_ was written expressly for—and performed with—the new music ensemble Bent Duo (David Friend, piano; Bill Solomon, percussion) and features Clayton’s live electronics. The performance was recorded on Thursday, December 6, 2018 in Adolphus Busch Hall at the Harvard Art Museums.',\n",

       "   'textiledescription': '_Animal-Shaped Vessels from the Ancient World: Feasting with Gods, Heroes, and Kings_ brings together nearly 60 elaborate vessels of animal shape from collections in the United States and Europe. While the songs, speeches, and prayers that enlivened ancient feasts are now largely lost to us, these vessels have survived, offering a glimpse into the rich symbolism and communal practices that found expression at these gatherings. Taking animal-shaped vessels as performative props in the multifaceted world of feasting, the exhibition not only introduces the social and ceremonial functions of these ritual occasions, but also highlights the essential and universal role played by food and drink—and by the highly imaginative containers used to enjoy these refreshments.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exhibition includes vessels in the shape of standing or reclining animals, animal-headed cups and beakers, drinking horns, and animated pitchers. Various creatures, real and imagined, give these objects their shapes: powerful bulls and rams, majestic lions and mythical griffins, wild boars and goats, deer and gazelles, graceful birds, and braying donkeys, among others. Assembling such a range of vessels for the first time, the exhibition presents a cross-cultural and cross-disciplinary examination of how they spanned geography and time, across three continents and over three millennia. The international menagerie of drinking and pouring vessels vividly illustrates not just how shapes and artistic forms crossed borders, but how ideas as well were exchanged among cultures—tangible evidence of close contact and the intermingling of traditions.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeyond their role in ritual and ceremonial drinking, animal-shaped vessels functioned variously as diplomatic gifts and tribute, the spoils of war, offerings to deities and the dead, and exotic objects of trade; they also were prized and emulated as symbols of status and prestige. Each object in the exhibition is a compelling animal study in itself, with a wealth of information embedded in its material, shape, and decoration. Many were made of rare or innovative materials—including gold, silver, bronze, glass, faience, and horn—and at the hands of skilled artists. They conveyed important information about their liquid contents and the nature of a gathering, but were also markers of social stature, identity, etiquette, and shared values.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the objects in the exhibition belong to a tradition of animal-shaped drinking and pouring vessels that persisted in the Near East and the Mediterranean from the Bronze Age in the third and second millennia BCE to the advent of Islam in the seventh century; this tradition eventually extended all the way to China, via the Silk Road. Select animal-shaped vessels from other cultures and periods—including East Asia, Africa, Europe, and South America—provide further points of comparison. In addition to the vessels, the exhibition features several related objects (paintings and sculpture) with ancient and modern representations of feasts. More than 20 domestic and international institutions have generously lent objects to the exhibition, including the Ashmolean Museum (Oxford University), the British Museum (London), the Louvre (Paris), the Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York), and the Museum of Fine Arts (Boston).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exhibition, curated by Susanne Ebbinghaus, the George M.A. Hanfmann Curator of Ancient Art and head of the Division of Asian and Mediterranean Art at the Harvard Art Museums, is accompanied by a full \"catalogue\":https://shop.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/frontpage/products/animal-shaped-vessels-from-the-ancient-world-feasting-with-gods-heroes-and-kings edited by Ebbinghaus.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrucial support for the _Animal-Shaped Vessels_ project has been made possible in part by a major grant from the \"National Endowment for the Humanities: Exploring the Human Endeavor\":https://www.neh.gov/. In addition, the Harvard Art Museums are deeply grateful to the anonymous donor of a gift in memory of Melvin R. Seiden and to Malcolm H. Wiener (Harvard A.B. ’57, J.D. ’63) and Michael and Helen Lehmann for enabling us to mount this exhibition and to pursue the related research. This work was also made possible in part by the following endowed funds: the David M. Robinson Fund; the Andrew W. Mellon Publication Funds, including the Henry P. McIlhenny Fund; and the M. Victor Leventritt Fund, which brings outstanding scholars of the history and theory of art to the Harvard and Greater Boston communities through the generosity of the wife, children, and friends of the late M. Victor Leventritt, Harvard Class of 1935.\\r\\n\\r\\nShare your experience on social media: #partyanimals #HarvardArtMuseums\\r\\n\\r\\n*Related Programming*\\r\\nThanks to a generous grant from the National Endowment from the Humanities, the museums are offering free admission to all visitors on Wednesday afternoons, 1–5pm, and on the first Saturday of each month, 10am–5pm, throughout the run of the Animal-Shaped Vessels exhibition.

       "   'textiledescription': \"_Mutiny: Works by Géricault_ explores compelling images by the Romantic period’s most influential artist, Théodore Géricault (1791–1824), whose powerful legacy endured long past his untimely death in his early thirties. Approximately 40 drawings, watercolors, lithographs, and paintings from the Harvard Art Museums collections, augmented by loans from three Boston-area collectors, tell a new story of this socially and politically engaged artist across a range of media.\\r\\n\\r\\nGéricault’s work both reflected and inflected the changes that took place during the Restoration period in Europe. Lasting from roughly 1815 to 1830, this was an ostensibly peaceful time in the aftermath of the French revolution and the Napoleonic wars; yet the continent was still recovering from the earlier violence, and the Industrial Revolution was making its presence felt through increased urbanization and the introduction of new technologies. Recognizing this turmoil, Géricault strove to represent the casual brutality at the center of modern life, forgoing mythological or religious subjects to focus squarely on the present. This interest appears not only in images of wounded soldiers and the urban poor, but also in works depicting men as they interacted with horses as well as in portrayals of animals in distress or at battle. _Mutiny_ considers Géricault as the prototype of the modern artist: rejecting the norms of society in order to expose its tensions and conflicts through depictions of competing extremes—physical strength and weakness.\\r\\n\\r\\nGéricault is today famed for his paintings, most notably _The Raft of the Medusa_ (now in the Louvre), but during his lifetime he was more widely known for his prints. In this exhibition, three of Géricault’s paintings will be presented alongside the lithographic prints that assured the artist’s posthumous fame. Capturing the world around him with a sense of vivid immediacy, Géricault’s drawings and watercolors are critical to understanding his goals as an artist, and the exhibition will feature 12 of these creations. \\r\\n\\r\\nCurated by A. Cassandra Albinson, Margaret S. Winthrop Curator of European Art; with contributions by Jessie Park, Rousseau Curatorial Fellow in European Art, and Ashley Hannebrink, Curatorial Graduate Student Intern in the Division of European and American Art, Harvard Art Museums.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis exhibition is made possible by funding from the Gurel Student Exhibition Fund. We also thank the three anonymous lenders, each of whom is dedicated to the study and appreciation of Géricault's work. \",\n",
