During the Civil War (1861–1865), American artist Winslow Homer (1836–1910) served as a correspondent for _Harper’s_. His sketches of soldiers, both in battle on the front lines and in quieter moments back at camp, were reproduced to accompany the journal’s accounts of the conflict. Homer worked for _Harper’s_ just as new technologies were making it possible to rapidly reproduce newsworthy images on a large scale. Working together with _Harper’s_ editors and engravers, he employed a range of pictorial strategies to reassure skeptical readers that his illustrations were not fabrications, but eyewitness observations “drawn on the spot.”

While in the field as an artist-correspondent, Homer developed habits of seeing and pictorial strategies that informed his work in other media. In addition to tracing these connections, this show explores broader questions that Homer’s art raises about the responsibility of artists who work in periods riven by war and conflict.

Co-curated by Ethan W. Lasser, Theodore E. Stebbins Jr. Curator of American Art and Head of the Division of European and American Art; and Makeda Best, Richard L. Menschel Curator of Photography; with the assistance of Oliver Wunsch, former Maher Curatorial Fellow of American Art (2018–19), Harvard Art Museums.

Support for this exhibition was provided by the Bolton Fund for American Art, Gift of the Payne Fund; and the Henry Luce Foundation Fund for the American Art Department. Exhibition-related programming is made possible by the Richard L. Menschel Endowment Fund and the M. Victor Leventritt Lecture Series Endowment Fund.

These technically refined and aesthetically exciting prints were among the earliest works of Asian art acquired by the Harvard Art Museums, first entering the collections in 1910. Today the museums house approximately 5,000 single-sheet Japanese woodblock prints, and this exhibition introduces a selection of superlative impressions from this lively medium. The exhibition also seeks to highlight the individuals whose generosity has made it possible for generations of Harvard students to encounter and learn from these works.

The exhibition features almost 50 works spanning the history of Japanese woodblock printing, from the 17th through 20th century; these include single-sheet prints, luxury _surimono_ prints, printed handscrolls, and printed books by renowned designers such as Suzuki Harunobu (1725–1770), pioneer of the full-color print; landscape specialist Utagawa Hiroshige (1797–1858); enigmatic designer Sharaku (active 1794–95), best known for “big head” (_ōkubi_) actor prints; Itō Jakuchū (1716–1800); and the ever-popular Katsushika Hokusai (1760–1849). Also included are modern “new print” (_shin hanga_) and “creative print” (_sōsaku hanga_) works by the leaders of these two 20th-century movements, as well as a selection of woodblock printing tools to enhance visitors’ understanding of the medium.

The exhibition also marks the first public presentation of the museums’ newest acquisition in the area of Japanese prints, a contemporary work by Noriko Saitō (b. 1973).

Legendary prince Shōtoku Taishi (c. 574–622) is regarded as the founder of Buddhism in Japan. At two years old (one by the Western count), he was believed to have taken several steps forward, faced east, put his hands together, and praised the Buddha. A sacred relic, the eyeball of the Buddha, then appeared between his hands. The diminutive life-size sculpture—the oldest and finest of its kind—depicts that miraculous moment.

This striking sculpture is remarkable not only for its seemingly animated presence, but also for the cache of more than 70 objects contained within the hollow body cavity. Sealed inside a veritable time capsule for over 700 years, these objects—relic grains, sutras, miniature sculptures, and scraps of paper inscribed with personalized poems and prayers—were carefully removed in the early 20th century. One of the most important objects from the group, an extremely rare printed Lotus Sutra dating to the Southern Song period (c. 1160), was subsequently gifted to the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. Thanks to the generosity of the Library of Congress, this exhibition reunites the Sutra with the remaining ensemble for the first time in over 70 years.

Also featured in the exhibition is the spectacular 14th-century painting _The Legendary Biography of Prince Shōtoku_, on loan from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The painting relates several miraculous incidents from the prince’s early life.

Commissioned for the Harvard Graduate Center by Harvard architecture professor and Bauhaus founding director Walter Gropius, the relief’s 13 panels were first installed in 1950 on facing walls of a popular dining room in Harkness Commons (now the Caspersen Center). Arp described its biomorphic shapes as primal forms inspired by nature, a connection made clear in the title of the work, which evokes a grouping of stars in the night sky. _Constellations II_ inaugurated a new chapter in Arp’s postwar practice. It was his first large-scale, site-specific artwork and led to others, including a metal relief for the UNESCO headquarters in Paris. 

By 1958, heavy use of the Harkness dining room had caused damage to the relief, prompting a new placement of the work above table height. Subsequent painting campaigns transformed the panels’ stained redwood finish to gray-blue, then to white, and back to natural. With the cooperation of Harvard Law School, which transferred the relief to the Harvard Art Museums in 2017, the Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies undertook a yearlong conservation initiative to restore the work to its original finish. 

The presentation of _Constellations II_ coincides with ""_The Bauhaus and Harvard_"":https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/visit/exhibitions/5615/the-bauhaus-and-harvard, the museums’ Spring 2019 special exhibition mounted in conjunction with the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Bauhaus.

Founded in 1919 and closed just 14 years later, the Bauhaus was the 20th century’s most influential school of art, architecture, and design. Harvard University played host to the first Bauhaus exhibition in the United States in 1930, and went on to become an unofficial center for the Bauhaus in America when founding director Walter Gropius joined Harvard’s department of architecture in 1937. Today the Busch-Reisinger Museum houses the largest Bauhaus collection outside Germany, initiated and assembled through the efforts of Gropius and many former teachers and students who emigrated from Nazi Germany, including Anni and Josef Albers, Herbert Bayer, Lyonel Feininger, and László Moholy-Nagy. 

The exhibition features rarely seen student exercises, iconic design objects, photography, textiles, typography, paintings, and archival materials. It explores the school’s pioneering approach to art education, the ways its workshops sought to revolutionize the experience of everyday life, the widespread influence of Bauhaus instruction in America, and Harvard’s own Graduate Center (1950), the first modernist building complex on campus, designed by Gropius’s firm The Architects Collaborative. A complementary exhibition installed in an adjacent gallery — ""_Hans Arp’s Constellations II_"":https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/visit/exhibitions/5755/hans-arps-constellations-ii — features one of the site-specific works commissioned for the Graduate Center. A publication inspired by _The Bauhaus and Harvard_ and its related programming is due out in March 2021. 

Organized by the Harvard Art Museums. Curated by Laura Muir, Research Curator in the Division of Academic and Public Programs, Harvard Art Museums. 

Support for this project is provided by endowed funds, including the Daimler Curatorship of the Busch-Reisinger Museum Fund, the Charles L. Kuhn Endowment Fund, and the Care of the Busch-Reisinger Museum Collection Fund. The publication is supported by the Harvard Art Museums Mellon Publication Funds, including the Carola B. Terwilliger Fund. In addition, exhibition related programming is made possible by the M.

After the school was shuttered under pressure from the Nazis in 1933, many Bauhaus artists brought their innovative practices and teaching methods to the United States. Gropius himself accepted a position at Harvard, where he would help establish a collection of Bauhaus material that has since grown to more than 30,000 objects—the largest such collection outside Germany. Harvard in turn became an unofficial center for the Bauhaus in America. Written by established and emerging voices in the field, the scholarship presented here expands on the special link between the two institutions, while highlighting understudied aspects of the Bauhaus, such as weaving, photography, and art made by women. Accompanied by beautiful illustrations—some of never-before-published objects—this book yields fascinating insights for Bauhaus devotees and design aficionados.\u3000A full reproduction of the six-page catalogue produced by the Harvard Society for Contemporary Art for its 1930 exhibition—the first Bauhaus exhibition in the United States—is included at the back of the book. \r\n\r\nLaura Muir is Associate Director of Academic and Public Programs and the Louis Miller Thayer Research Curator at the Harvard Art Museums.\r\nWith contributions by Francesca G.

Judith Raum places the workshop and its predominantly female weavers at the center of two films on view in the Lightbox Gallery.

Archival photographs and close-ups of fabrics show the material and structural complexity that Bauhaus weavers achieved while also relating these tactile qualities to the institutional politics and aesthetics of their time. Raum’s films are a result of her extensive research on Bauhaus fabrics in European archives and here at Harvard’s Busch-Reisinger Museum, which houses the largest Bauhaus collection outside Germany. 

A Berlin-based artist and author, Raum creates installations and presents lecture-performances based on archival research and investigations into social and economic history. She made the films in this exhibition as part of a larger project on the Bauhaus weaving workshop, _Bauhaus Space_ (2017), commissioned by Germany’s _ifa_ Institut für Auslandsbeziehungen for the exhibition _The Event of a Thread_. Selected wall hangings and fabrics pictured in the films are featured in the exhibition ""_The Bauhaus and Harvard_"":https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/visit/exhibitions/5615/the-bauhaus-and-harvard, on view at the Harvard Art Museums from February 8–July 28, 2019. 

_Judith Raum: Raveled Fabrics_ is presented in the Lightbox Gallery, an experimental space for digital research and development at the Harvard Art Museums. Developed in collaboration with faculty, staff, students, and visiting artists, projects in the Lightbox Gallery challenge how we document, share, and examine collections and collections data. Some of these projects are responsive, allowing users to navigate and manipulate the collections; others are cinematic, transforming the museums into a landscape of digital performance.

Mobility of ideas, peoples, and works established intellectual and material networks that constructed modern architecture as an international event. This exhibition explores the vibrant cosmopolitan architecture culture in Latin America during the interwar period, using original materials from archival collections at Harvard. Presented here are works by Argentinian architects Jorge Ferrari Hardoy and Juan Kurchan, who collaborated with Le Corbusier, and by German architect Franz Möller, who worked with Walter Gropius, both of whom were key propagandists of modern architecture.

In 1931, Möller opened the office Gropius-Moller Arquitectos in Buenos Aires. Among the firm’s projects was the Ciudad Balnearia de Chapadmalal, a private commission for a large-scale seaside resort, represented here by the clubhouse. This high-end leisure development contrasts with Gropius Standard—a one-story, low-cost house intended for young professional couples that could transform over time to meet the needs of a growing family. This system continued Gropius’s interests in prefabrication, which can be traced back to his Bauhaus years, but was adjusted to suit local building and climatic conditions.

In the early 1940s, Ferrari Hardoy and Kurchan conceived of an apartment building on Virrey del Pino Street to showcase the possibilities of “city in the park” modern planning; they envisioned the project as a fragment of a future greater whole. The 10-story apartment block is set back on an urban lot, and an ample garden separates the building from the street. Three august carefully preserved eucalyptus trees were woven into the facade, fusing practical climatic considerations and formal aesthetic concerns. Both architects were engaged in the Plan Director, a master plan for the Argentinian capital that had been developed with Le Corbusier in Paris. Le Corbusier’s daring proposal for skyscrapers on the Rio de la Plata, which had sprung from his 1929 visit to Argentina, would have extended the city of the Pampas into the river. This key functional and symbolic node sets the development of the Plan Director into a multinode city linked by circulation arteries. After the war, working for the city government, Ferrari Hardoy and Kurchan refined the plan and vigorously endeavored to publicize and implement it.

Owned by John Glover, who died during his passage across the Atlantic, the object transferred to Glover’s widow Elizabeth, who later married Henry Dunster, the first president of Harvard. _The Great Salt_ (on display in the silver cabinet on Level 2, ""Gallery 2340"":https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/visit/floor-plan/2/2340?gallery=2340) is one of seven pieces of historic Harvard silver. This shape-shifting container, designed to hold salt for the dining table at a time when the mineral was a rare and valuable commodity, is invested with centuries of prestige. Originally the charge of the most important person sitting at the table, _The Great Salt_ continued to be used throughout the 20th century as part of the regalia for inauguration ceremonies of new Harvard presidents.

This object was selected by Jace Clayton, a visiting artist at the Harvard Art Museums, as the subject for a digital response—a sonic extension and intervention into _The Great Salt_’s narrative. A display vitrine, much like those that protect precious objects elsewhere in the museums, here holds approximately 40 electronic synthesizer modules, connected with multicolored cables. Programmed using granular synthesis, a technique that breaks a sound into tiny “grains,” this collection of electronic components performs a new work—a composition designed by Clayton to self-modulate, actively generating new sounds and changing as it repeats. Three marímbulas—Afro-Cuban thumb pianos—surround the vitrine and can be played by visitors, affecting the presentation of the electronic sound.

The year 1638, just as _The Great Salt_ made its way to Massachusetts, was also when the first enslaved Africans arrived in the colony. This installation includes references to both 17th-century European and African musical forms, playing with associations between _The Great Salt_, the sea, and the Middle Passage. Through sound, the installation responds to _The Great Salt_ with acts of performance, translation, and participation.

Jace Clayton, Harvard College class of ’97, is an artist and writer based in New York City. Also known for his performances as DJ /rupture, Clayton creates interdisciplinary works that explore interactions among sound, memory, and public space. His sonic experiments have been exhibited at the Andy Warhol Museum and Barnes Foundation, and his works travel internationally in the form of music, writing, and frequent live performances. Clayton joined the faculty of Bard College in 2013 and recently served as the Nannerl Keohane Distinguished Visiting Professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Duke University. He has been an artist-in-residence with the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council and the Eyebeam Art + Technology Atelier, as well as a USC Annenberg/Getty Arts Journalism Fellow.

While the songs, speeches, and prayers that enlivened ancient feasts are now largely lost to us, these vessels have survived, offering a glimpse into the rich symbolism and communal practices that found expression at these gatherings. Taking animal-shaped vessels as performative props in the multifaceted world of feasting, the exhibition not only introduces the social and ceremonial functions of these ritual occasions, but also highlights the essential and universal role played by food and drink—and by the highly imaginative containers used to enjoy these refreshments.

The exhibition includes vessels in the shape of standing or reclining animals, animal-headed cups and beakers, drinking horns, and animated pitchers. Various creatures, real and imagined, give these objects their shapes: powerful bulls and rams, majestic lions and mythical griffins, wild boars and goats, deer and gazelles, graceful birds, and braying donkeys, among others. Assembling such a range of vessels for the first time, the exhibition presents a cross-cultural and cross-disciplinary examination of how they spanned geography and time, across three continents and over three millennia. The international menagerie of drinking and pouring vessels vividly illustrates not just how shapes and artistic forms crossed borders, but how ideas as well were exchanged among cultures—tangible evidence of close contact and the intermingling of traditions.

Beyond their role in ritual and ceremonial drinking, animal-shaped vessels functioned variously as diplomatic gifts and tribute, the spoils of war, offerings to deities and the dead, and exotic objects of trade; they also were prized and emulated as symbols of status and prestige. Each object in the exhibition is a compelling animal study in itself, with a wealth of information embedded in its material, shape, and decoration. Many were made of rare or innovative materials—including gold, silver, bronze, glass, faience, and horn—and at the hands of skilled artists. They conveyed important information about their liquid contents and the nature of a gathering, but were also markers of social stature, identity, etiquette, and shared values.

Most of the objects in the exhibition belong to a tradition of animal-shaped drinking and pouring vessels that persisted in the Near East and the Mediterranean from the Bronze Age in the third and second millennia BCE to the advent of Islam in the seventh century; this tradition eventually extended all the way to China, via the Silk Road. Select animal-shaped vessels from other cultures and periods—including East Asia, Africa, Europe, and South America—provide further points of comparison. In addition to the vessels, the exhibition features several related objects (paintings and sculpture) with ancient and modern representations of feasts. More than 20 domestic and international institutions have generously lent objects to the exhibition, including the Ashmolean Museum (Oxford University), the British Museum (London), the Louvre (Paris), the Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York), and the Museum of Fine Arts (Boston).

Approximately 40 drawings, watercolors, lithographs, and paintings from the Harvard Art Museums collections, augmented by loans from three Boston-area collectors, tell a new story of this socially and politically engaged artist across a range of media.

Géricault’s work both reflected and inflected the changes that took place during the Restoration period in Europe. Lasting from roughly 1815 to 1830, this was an ostensibly peaceful time in the aftermath of the French revolution and the Napoleonic wars; yet the continent was still recovering from the earlier violence, and the Industrial Revolution was making its presence felt through increased urbanization and the introduction of new technologies. Recognizing this turmoil, Géricault strove to represent the casual brutality at the center of modern life, forgoing mythological or religious subjects to focus squarely on the present. This interest appears not only in images of wounded soldiers and the urban poor, but also in works depicting men as they interacted with horses as well as in portrayals of animals in distress or at battle. _Mutiny_ considers Géricault as the prototype of the modern artist: rejecting the norms of society in order to expose its tensions and conflicts through depictions of competing extremes—physical strength and weakness.

Géricault is today famed for his paintings, most notably _The Raft of the Medusa_ (now in the Louvre), but during his lifetime he was more widely known for his prints. In this exhibition, three of Géricault’s paintings will be presented alongside the lithographic prints that assured the artist’s posthumous fame. Capturing the world around him with a sense of vivid immediacy, Géricault’s drawings and watercolors are critical to understanding his goals as an artist, and the exhibition will feature 12 of these creations.

For three millennia, in Jewish, Christian, and Muslim worlds, people reasoned ethically through the seedpod of this—even to early audiences—unreasonable tale: the first man and woman, formed by God at the apex of the world’s creation, disobey their creator by eating a forbidden fruit, are punished by sickness, hardship, and death, and pass their curse to the future human species.

From the early Christian period onward, in countless thought-provoking forms, visual artists endeavored to picture this story. In doing so, they had to make certain practical decisions, each requiring reasoning about the unreasonable: for example, which moment in the story to show as the decisive one, and how to display innocent, paradisiacal nudity to a fallen audience stained by shame and lust. Designed for a course in “Ethical Reasoning” offered by Harvard College’s Program in General Education, this installation features works from the Harvard Art Museums and Houghton Library. It explores how artists from the Renaissance to the modern era met the challenges of a foundational story.

These challenges were partly aesthetic, as artists labored to create ever livelier and better proportioned nudes. But there were ethical challenges as well. Picturing what happened in Eden, artists hinted at why. And they pondered imponderables that resulted from the crime, such as disease, toil, gender inequality, and death. European encounters with New World inhabitants raised new questions about nudity, human diversity, and the universality of the biblical story itself. Including works by Dürer, Rembrandt, Blake, Munch, and Beckmann, this installation is both the history of an image and a miniature history of Western art.

This installation’s related course is taught by Joseph Koerner, Victor S. Thomas Professor of the History of Art and Architecture; and Stephen Greenblatt, John Cogan University Professor of the Humanities, Harvard University.

The University Teaching Gallery serves faculty and students affiliated with Harvard’s Department of History of Art and Architecture. Semester-long installations are mounted in conjunction with undergraduate and graduate courses, supporting instruction in the critical analysis of art and making unique selections from the museums’ collections available to all visitors.

Paik was born in Korea but spent much of his life in the United States; his practice combined music, performance, sculpture, painting and drawing, video, and broadcast television, among other media.

Drawn almost entirely from the Harvard Art Museums collections, the exhibition reveals the striking breadth of Paik’s oeuvre from the 1960s through early 2000s. Eight of the works featured are recent gifts from Ken Hakuta (M.B.A. ’77), the artist’s nephew; he has generously established the Nam June Paik Fellowship to expand knowledge about the artist, his work, and his influences. The objects on view—many of which are being exhibited at the museums for the first time—include ""_TV Crown_"":https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/358178  (1965/99), a television modified to visualize sound waves on its screen, and an iconic ""_TV Buddha_"":https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/358175 (2004), part of the artist’s exploration of closed-circuit television. Together, they represent themes central to Paik’s work, including the subversion of conventional technologies and media, the potential of moving images to explore alternative temporalities, and technology’s concern with aging and obsolescence. The works also demonstrate Paik’s playful, often ironic approach.

In addition, the exhibition draws attention to Paik’s enduring interest in artistic collaboration, from his early association with John Cage and others active in the postwar avant-garde music scene to his lifelong friendships with Charlotte Moorman and Joseph Beuys. Several works on view relate directly to the artist’s involvement with the Fluxus group, whose interest in revolutionizing artistic distribution had a lasting influence on Paik’s thinking. The exhibition also features two videos that the artist made in conjunction with WGBH, Boston’s public television station, where he developed some of his most important projects in the late 1960s and early ’70s.

Curated by Mary Schneider Enriquez, Houghton Associate Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art, and Marina Isgro, Nam June Paik Research Fellow, Harvard Art Museums.

Support for this project was provided by the Rosenblatt Fund for Post-War American Art, the José Soriano Fund, the Agnes Gund Fund for Modern and Contemporary Art, and the M. Victor Leventritt Fund.

Burns (b. 1975) for the Harvard Art Museums takes the life and art of David Wojnarowicz as a point of departure. Wojnarowicz’s work is part of the exhibition <em>""Analog Culture: Printer’s Proofs from the Schneider/Erdman Photography Lab, 1981–2001"":https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/visit/exhibitions/5630/analog-culture-printers-proofs-from-the-schneidererdman-photography-lab-19812001</em>, also on display at the museums May 19–August 12, 2018. Burns provided this description of the installation:

p(((. The human body requires a tremendous amount of maintenance: fuel, protection from the elements, psychic safety, buffers from violence and illness. Yet the bodies that persist do so in a state of uncertainty between lethal events and the inevitable degradation caused by time. <em>Survivor’s Remorse</em> looks at the valuation of various forms of vitality—not only lives but the material residue of lives—particularly through the economy of art. This work was spurred by a painful realization I had while looking through David Wojnarowicz’s photo prints in the Harvard Art Museums study rooms: art institutions take painstaking care of bodies of work (the art object), yet medical, political, and social institutions would not properly care for David’s body throughout his lifetime—because he was queer, had AIDS, and at times was homeless.

p(((. The Lightbox Gallery looks onto the Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies. Here, in the sterile, evenly lit environment dedicated to the restoration of artwork, one may observe conservators at work both in real life and amplified in detail within the video work itself. <em>Survivor’s Remorse</em> includes a shipping crate that holds one monitor. Removed from the other eight screens on the wall, and contained within a protective tomb, the lone screen appears to be in sync while at other times it falters.

p(((. <em>Survivor’s Remorse</em> queries how various institutions value different types of bodies and in what ways creative labor can be particularly toxic. Why does the value of an artist’s work often increase after death? In what ways does the fluctuating and irregular valuation of an artist’s cultural capital affect his or her ability to live? As the old narrative goes, the artist, or visionary, or genius lives on “the fringes of society” or is seen as “ahead of her time”—in other words, is perceived as being “out of sync.” Marginalized bodies exist on “the margins” because institutions either ignore or do not adapt to the experiences of the non-normative, non-citizen, poor, ill, or racialized subject. Yet the marginalized “genius” or others deemed exceptional (sometimes by the extreme scale of their loss, as in the case of genocide) may be recuperated and highly valued through historicizing institutions—but often only after they are gone. <em>Survivor’s Remorse</em> examines this paradox and the sociopolitical influences that create the chasm between these value systems.

Organized by Jennifer Quick, John R. and Barbara Robinson Family Associate Research Curator in Photography, and Chris Molinski, Associate Research Curator for Digital Initiatives, with Jessica Bardsley, Agnes Mongan Curatorial Intern, Harvard Art Museums.

<em>A. K. Burns: Survivor’s Remorse</em> is built for the Lightbox Gallery, an experimental space for the research and development of digital tools for the Harvard Art Museums. Developed in collaboration with faculty, staff, students, and visiting artists, projects in the Lightbox Gallery challenge how we document, share, and examine collections and collections data. Some of these projects are responsive, allowing users to navigate and manipulate the collections; others are cinematic, transforming the museums into a landscape of digital performance.

The collection includes works by Richard Avedon, James Casebere, Robert Gober, Nan Goldin, Peter Hujar, Gilles Peress, and David Wojnarowicz, among many other artists, photojournalists, and fashion photographers who made up New York’s cultural milieu in the 1980s and ’90s. As Schneider and Erdman began to build a collection of photographs, through their practice of retaining a print from each artist with whom they collaborated, they came to realize the educational value of this unique body of work. Comprising approximately 90 printer’s proofs as well as related archival material and artist’s tools, the exhibition highlights the collection’s teaching potential by looking closely at the techniques and methods of darkroom photography. It ties the material history of darkroom photography to the historical narratives that Schneider and Erdman experienced, such as the transformation of New York’s urban landscape, the AIDS crisis and its repercussions in American culture, and September 11, 2001.

The Schneider/Erdman Printer’s Proof Collection was acquired by the Harvard Art Museums in two parts, in 2011 and 2016, as a combined gift and purchase through the support of the Margaret Fisher Fund. In addition, Schneider and Erdman gifted a collection of archival material, including photographs, test prints, glass plate negatives, vintage material, and studio records, in 2017. Altogether, these acquisitions have reinforced the museums’ place as a primary site for the study, research, exhibition, and interpretation of contemporary photography.

A ""publication"":https://shop.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/frontpage/products/analog-culture-printer-s-proofs-from-the-schneider-erdman-photography-lab-1981-2001 accompanying the exhibition looks in-depth at the photography lab’s technical, material, and interpersonal intricacies. Part oral history, the book unites original essays with excerpts of interviews and conversations with Schneider as well as with Deborah Bell, James Casebere, Robert Gober, John Schabel, and Lorna Simpson. In addition, through two personal reflections, Schneider recalls what it was like to print works for Peter Hujar and David Wojnarowicz. Including an engaging glossary specific to the practice of Schneider/Erdman, Inc., this volume will capture the attention of students, scholars, and general analog enthusiasts. A complementary online ""Special Collection"":https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/special-collections/the-schneider-erdman-printer-s-proof-collection?group=Analog+Culture features case studies by Harvard graduate students, and functions as the primary digital repository for the printer’s proof collection and its related materials.

Curated by Jennifer Quick, John R. and Barbara Robinson Family Associate Research Curator in Photography, Division of Modern and Contemporary Art, Harvard Art Museums.

The printer’s proofs came to the Harvard Art Museums through the generosity of Gary Schneider and John Erdman, who have long understood the value of the photographs as a teaching collection. The acquisition was also made possible in part by the Margaret Fisher Fund. Further support for this project was provided by the Widgeon Point Charitable Foundation; the Harvard Art Museums Mellon Publication Funds, including the Carola B. Terwilliger Fund; the John R. and Barbara Robinson Family Fund for Photography; the Agnes Gund Fund for Modern and Contemporary Art; the M. Victor Leventritt Fund; and the Richard L.

Taking its name from a 1945 poem by Günter Eich, the exhibition focuses on modern art created at a time when Germans were forced to acknowledge and reckon with the atrocities of World War II and the Holocaust, the country’s defeat and occupation by the Allies, and the ideological ramifications of the fledgling Cold War. Chosen for the way it helps characterize the art of this period, the word <i>Inventur</i> (inventory) implies not just an artistic stocktaking, but a physical and moral one as well—the reassurance of one’s own existence as reflected in the stuff of everyday life. The exhibition, too, “takes stock,” introducing the richness and variety of the modern art of this period to new audiences, while prompting broader questions on the role of the creative individual living under totalitarianism and in its wake. 

<i>Inventur</i> includes more than 160 works, encompassing nearly 50 artists; many of the works have never been on view outside Germany. The exhibition draws from the Harvard Art Museums’ Busch-Reisinger and Fogg collections and is complemented by works from more than 50 public and private collections in the United States and in Germany. It includes key artists from across Germany who worked in an array of media: photography, collage, photomontage, drawing, painting, sculpture, and commercial design.

The exhibition is accompanied by a fully illustrated <a href=""https://shop.harvardartmuseums.org/products/inventur-art-in-germany-1943-55"" target=""_blank"">catalogue</a> with two essays and sixty in-depth object entries written by the curator and emerging scholars in the field. This publication, the first of its kind in English, will contribute a wealth of new knowledge to scholarly understanding of 20th-century German art.

Organized by the Harvard Art Museums. Curated by Lynette Roth, the Daimler Curator of the Busch-Reisinger Museum and Head of the Division of Modern and Contemporary Art at the Harvard Art Museums.

Support for this project was provided by the German Friends of the Busch-Reisinger Museum (Verein der Freunde des Busch-Reisinger Museums) and by endowed funds, including the Daimler Curatorship of the Busch-Reisinger Museum Fund, the M. Victor Leventritt Fund, and the Richard L. Menschel Endowment Fund. In addition, modern and contemporary art programs at the Harvard Art Museums are made possible in part by generous support from the Emily Rauh Pulitzer and Joseph Pulitzer, Jr., Fund for Modern and Contemporary Art.

One of the most influential artist duos working in the age of the Internet, JODI has produced a new project, <i>OXO</i> (2018), for the Lightbox Gallery, a collaborative space for digital projects on the museums’ uppermost level.

Based on the game tic-tac-toe, <i>OXO</i> is an interactive multichannel installation influenced by early computer games, including <i>Noughts and Crosses</i> or <i>OXO</i>, a game built in 1952 by Alexander S. Douglas. JODI’s installation responds to this early history of computing, war games, and artificial intelligence, thinking through the game tic-tac-toe as an important cultural artifact. Visit the Lightbox Gallery to play <i>OXO</i> throughout the installation.

The installation is organized by Mary Schneider Enriquez, Houghton Associate Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art, and Chris Molinski, Associate Research Curator for Digital Initiatives, at the Harvard Art Museums.

Presented in collaboration with the Institute of Contemporary Art/Boston (ICA) exhibition <i>Art in the Age of the Internet, 1989 to Today</i> (February 7–May 20, 2018), which explores the extensive effects of the Internet on artistic practice and contemporary culture. <i>Art in the Age of the Internet</i> is organized by Eva Respini, Barbara Lee Chief Curator, and Jeffrey De Blois, Curatorial Associate, at the ICA.

This installation—matching the Harvard survey course it accompanies—reverses that familiar direction. The sequence proceeds from recent art back to the Renaissance. This retrospective history of art is meant to capture the point of view of artists themselves, who have, for generations, tried—variously—to preserve, transform, surpass, or overturn what came before them. A reverse perspective also accords with how humans are situated in history, looking back inescapably from a position in the present moment, but also powerfully shaped by the past. And it echoes the time sequence of geological sediment through which one has to dig from new layers to older ones.

Looking back on selected artworks from the Western tradition allows us to observe that even the most radical contemporary departures depend heavily on the art of the past and therefore that the Old Masters are relevant still. Visitors are invited to travel the sequence in both directions, from present to past and from past to present, experiencing the different connections, stories, and dislocations that arise.  

The installation’s related course is taught by Jeffrey F. Hamburger, the Kuno Francke Professor of German Art and Culture; and Joseph Koerner, the Victor S. Thomas Professor of the History of Art and Architecture at Harvard University.

Bryce, who was born in Peru but has lived extensively in Berlin and New York, selectively reconstructs images from early issues of the <em>UNESCO Courier</em>, published in English, French, and Spanish since 1948. Over its history, the journal has focused on science, education, race, culture, politics, and international strife, among other subjects.

<em>The Book of Needs</em>, created in 2015, shows just how pertinent these themes remain. An assemblage and reconstruction of <em>Courier</em> pages, columns, and photographs, Bryce’s work purposefully illuminates and critiques the ideology behind the content of each page he selects. Following painstaking archival research, Bryce fastidiously re-creates his selected historical documents—word by word and image by image—using ink applied with watercolor brushes. The artist calls this process “mimetic analysis” and refers to himself as a para-historian. Instead of <em>explaining</em> history, as a conventional historian might, Bryce aims to <em>show</em> history. He “reveals” history through his hand and perspective: his deliberate choice of subjects as well as his selective enlargement and placement of image and text.

The 81 drawings in <em>The Book of Needs</em> vary in size but are installed so as to be experienced as a single work, beginning with three issues of the <em>Courier</em> that introduce themes critical to the publication: <em>Race and History</em> by Claude Levi-Strauss, <em>Race and Culture</em> by Michel Leiris, and <em>Race and Biology</em> by L. C. Dunn. The exact images and articles chosen by the artist further highlight these subjects, with the dangerous consequences of racism and nationalism punctuating the expanse of drawings. While the installation speaks most directly to the years following World War II, the issues remain hauntingly relevant today.

One of the most celebrated was Giovanni Battista Piranesi (1720–1778), a Venetian who spent his entire career in Rome. He produced on average two etchings a month (fourteen are featured in this installation), and his image of Roman grandeur left an indelible stamp on the European imagination. His <i>vedute</i> (city views), meant for Grand Tour visitors, show the most famous monuments of Rome, many now Christianized, as well as the palaces and villas of <i>Roma moderna</i>. Palazzo Barberini and Villa Albani housed notable collections of ancient sculpture and were centers for the study of the antique. An interior view of San Paolo fuori le Mura shows how Constantinian churches, such as St. Peter’s, originally looked, while another of San Giovanni in Laterano shows such a church after its Baroque transformation.

The Stadium of Domitian succumbed to ruin in the Middle Ages but left its trace on the urban landscape as Piazza Navona. Pope Innocent X (1644–55) transformed it with a palace and church built over the ancient seating. Piranesi shows the finished square while an earlier printmaker, Dominique Barrière (1618–1678), shows it in 1650 with Bernini’s <i>Four Rivers</i> fountain almost complete but the church of Sant’Agnese not yet begun.

Rome was the best watered city in the world thanks to its system of aqueducts. Pliny, in his <i>Natural History</i>, favorably compared the achievement to the building of the pyramids in Egypt. Both the Trevi Fountain and the Acqua Paola adopt the triumphal arch motif to celebrate the arrival of the waters. 

Then as now visitors could mount to the top of St. Peter’s. A splendid drawing of 1641 by Israël Silvestre (1621–1691) shows the Vatican palace and Bernini’s unfinished bell tower. The square in front of the church shows the obelisk that was moved there in 1586 but not yet Bernini’s colonnade, begun two decades later.

Indeed, there were slaves at Harvard for more than 140 years, serving presidents, stewards, and professors. While student debates or disputations were regularly held at Harvard, this exchange is the only example for which a full verbatim record survives.

<i>No More, America</i>, a film by Peter Galison, reimagines this original debate to include the powerful voice of Phillis Wheatley, an acclaimed poet, then-enslaved, who lived just across the Charles River from the two Harvard students. All three were 21 years old at the time of the disputation. Though her book <i>Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral</i> appeared in London in 1773, Wheatley’s voice, contemporaneous with the disputation, would never have originally appeared alongside the debate. In this film, Wheatley’s presence serves as an intervention, rejecting the racist rhetoric employed by both sides through excerpts from her published works.

Presented in conjunction with <i><a href=""http://www.harvardartmuseums.org/visit/exhibitions/4916/the-philosophy-chamber-art-and-science-in-harvards-teaching-cabinet-1766-1820"" target=""_blank"">The Philosophy Chamber: Art and Science in Harvard’s Teaching Cabinet, 1766–1820</a></i>, this film—and the exhibition that inspired it—challenges us to consider what voices were missing from the original Philosophy Chamber and offers a powerful lens for thinking through the collection, now reassembled in the exhibition on view on Level 3. Performed by three current Harvard students, this work is especially jarring given the relevance of continued racial inequality on campus. These student actors are part of a larger movement to redress the university’s own history of slavery. As Harvard president Drew Faust has argued: “The past never dies or disappears. It continues to shape us in ways we should not try to erase or ignore. In more fully acknowledging our history, Harvard must do its part to undermine the legacies of race and slavery that continue to divide our nation.”

The republic was characterized by religious tolerance, a large urban middle class, and growing economic and military might. Amid these favorable conditions, an extremely vibrant artistic scene emerged, heralding the arrival of the Dutch Golden Age.

Featuring works from the esteemed collection of Maida and George Abrams (Harvard A.B. ’54, LL.B. ’57), this installation of 31 drawings explores the extraordinary developments in Dutch art in the period between 1590 and 1630. The works on view present some of the major themes in Dutch art, including the development of high and low genres, the study of landscape, and the interest in the nude; many of these subjects initially emerged in the medium of drawing. Beyond its central role in the creative conception of any work of art, drawing came to be regarded as an autonomous and technically ambitious art form. The works on display celebrate the role of drawing as a catalyst of creativity during the early Golden Age.


Organized by the Harvard Art Museums. Curated by Austėja Mackelaitė, the Stanley H. Durwood Foundation Curatorial Fellow, with assistance from Susan Anderson, Curatorial Research Associate for Dutch and Flemish Drawings, both in the Division of European and American Art at the Harvard Art Museums.

This installation was made possible in part by the Stanley H. Durwood Foundation Support Fund.

As the century unfolded, the new Qajar dynasty sought to unify a country torn by decades of civil war, even as the outside world increasingly intruded on Iranian affairs. The expansionist ambitions and technological advances of European powers brought Westerners to Iran and, to a later and lesser extent, drew Iranians to the West. Stimulated and challenged by developments both inside and outside their country, Persian artists mastered new image-making technologies and readily assimilated an unprecedented influx of pictorial material from abroad into their traditional art forms. 
 
This exhibition brings together four principal art forms—lacquer, lithography, photography, and painting and drawing on paper—to explore their separate and intertwined histories, contexts of production, and means of dissemination across sectors of society ranging from the courtly elite to the citizenry at large. The almost 80 works in the exhibition, most of which have never before been exhibited, include illustrated books, album folios, pen boxes, mirror cases, single-sheet painted and printed images, and photographs. Several of the objects are on loan from collections within Harvard University and from private and public collections in the United States and abroad. Many of the Qajar era’s most interesting and accomplished artists are represented in the exhibition, including Abu al-Hasan Ghaffari Saniʿ al-Mulk, Antoin Sevruguin, Mubarak Mirza b. Mahmud, Mirza ʿAli Quli Khaw’i, Muhammad Ismaʿil, Muhammad Riza al-Imami, and members of the Najaf ʿAli circle of lacquer artists.

This catalogue presents a fresh take on the art of the period, setting aside the value judgments that shaped early responses to instead examine the effects and results of new technologies of representation across a variety of mediums. The book foregrounds the inherent relationship and movement among mediums and images, both traditional and new, while deflecting primary attention from royal patronage to more public and widely accessible forms of image-making. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn bringing together four principal art forms—lacquer, painting and drawing on paper, lithography, and photography—the authors explore the separate and intertwined histories of these mediums, their contexts of production, and their means of dissemination across sectors of society ranging from the courtly elite to the citizenry at large. The book considers how the breadth of mediums and subject matters evidenced by these objects could be matched only by the diverse formats through which images were embodied and circulated in the world. Indeed, unlike their European contemporaries, Qajar artists and patrons were not concerned about systems of image duplication and translation—a key aspect this book takes up in its effort to approach Qajar art on its own terms, not as a lesser manifestation of Western ideals.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis catalogue accompanies the exhibition Technologies of the Image: Art in 19th-Century Iran, on view at the Harvard Art Museums from August 26, 2017 through January 7, 2018.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDavid J.

Because these types of works were originally created as technical materials for artists to use in their daily work, most have been lost over time as a result of repeated use and subsequent damage or disposal. This publication offers a rare opportunity not only to appreciate the ingenuity of the individual works, but also to gain a better understanding of the entire system of artistic production and exchange in 19th-century Iran.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe book unites 12 essays with a beautiful full-size facsimile of the complete album. From the necessarily global story of how the album came to be housed at the Harvard Art Museums—spanning Iran, Germany, England, and the United States—to the in-depth examination of individual themes and techniques, the publication exposes a rich network of artistic influence, exchange, and innovation.

As a respected collector of Persian art, Mrs. Soudavar appreciated these lacquerworks for both their artistic quality and historical value. As a connoisseur of calligraphy and well versed in the art of penmanship, she cherished the pen cases and boxes for their association with her personal skill and enjoyment of the art of writing.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAbolala Soudavar generously offered his mother’s collection of Persian lacquerware as a gift to the Harvard Art Museums in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and to the Smithsonian’s Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M.

The resulting print series, known as <em>Seven poems by Stéphane Mallarmé</em>, is also connected to an elaborate group of works by Wilmarth—charcoal and pastel drawings, etchings, and wall sculptures—each titled after the first line of a Mallarmé poem, known collectively as <em>Breath</em>. This exhibition is selected primarily from these paintings, drawings, sculptures, and prints; it focuses on the way that Wilmarth worked in a variety of media to deal with the themes of Mallarmé’s poems and to shape his project. The exhibition also includes related works on loan from two private collections, providing a sense of how the Mallarmé project continued to inform Wilmarth’s sculpture in the years that followed. While the exhibition largely features works related to or emerging from the Mallarmé project, it also highlights several other sculptures from the Harvard Art Museums collections—including two early, Brancusi-inspired wood sculptures (part of a recent gift of the Susan Wilmarth estate) and the recently acquired <a href=""http://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/352932"" target=""_blank""><em>October Ladders</em></a>—that have never previously been exhibited at the museums.

The materials in the online repository include technical specification sheets, diagrams, and maquettes for assembling many of the Wilmarth sculptures that can be found in collections worldwide, as well as installation shots of the works. Some of Wilmarth’s musical recordings are also available through the special collection.

These numbered Jun wares—so named because each is marked on its base with a single Chinese numeral—have long been admired for their fine potting, distinctive shapes, and radiant purple and blue glazes. Opinions on these vessels’ dates of origin vary widely, and given the scarcity of numbered Jun in most museum collections, a comprehensive study of this unusual ware has never been undertaken outside the imperial collections in China and Taiwan. 

Drawn entirely from the museums’ permanent collections, this exhibition introduces the typology, technical characteristics, collecting history, and controversies surrounding numbered Jun ware. It features approximately half of the museums’ 60 numbered Jun, all of which were given to Harvard in 1942 by Boston-area collectors Ernest B. Dane (Harvard College Class of 1892) and his wife Helen Pratt Dane. This exhibition marks the 75th anniversary of the Danes’ extraordinary gift of nearly 300 Chinese ceramics and later jades. It is also the first focused exhibition of their unique collection of palace Jun ware since it came to Harvard.

The exhibition is complemented by an online resource that provides further contextualization of Harvard’s entire numbered Jun collection. The <a href=""http://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/special-collections/numbered-jun-ware"" target=""_blank"">Numbered Jun Ware Special Collection</a> introduces this remarkable ceramic ware and explores its many complexities through descriptive summaries of its typology, technical characteristics, controversies, and collecting history, accompanied by a selection of representative images. 

Curated by Melissa A. Moy, the Alan J. Dworsky Associate Curator of Chinese Art at the Harvard Art Museums.

The exhibition and online special collections feature are funded in part by the Gregory and Maria Henderson Fund and by generous support from Terry and William Carey.

Berenson prized these works at his home in Florence, Villa I Tatti, which he bequeathed to Harvard and which now serves as the Harvard University Center for Italian Renaissance Studies. The exhibition offers the first opportunity to see these works outside Villa I Tatti. 

Works in the exhibition are grouped according to the style in which each was created between the 14th and 17th centuries in Iran and Central Asia. Berenson’s important 15th-century Timurid manuscript will be displayed in an unbound state as part of an ongoing conservation and rebinding process. The show will also include additional related works from the Harvard Art Museums, the Morgan Library and Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. These works were collected by close associates of Berenson who shared his enthusiasm for Persian painting, at a time when this area of art was gaining considerable prestige among collectors. 

The exhibition sheds important new light on Berenson’s little-known and understudied Persian collection, highlighting current research from various scholars on Berenson’s collecting interests and the artistic and cultural significance of the objects.

These objects were displayed in a set of three rooms adjacent to the college library in Harvard Hall, a large brick building that still stands at the center of campus today. The largest of these spaces, the Philosophy Chamber, was an ornately decorated room named for the discipline of natural philosophy, a cornerstone of the Enlightenment-era curriculum that wove together astronomy, mathematics, physics, and other sciences in an attempt to explain natural objects and physical phenomena. The collection and the chamber played a vital role in teaching and research at Harvard, while also serving as the center of artistic and intellectual life in the greater New England region for over 50 years. Artists, scientists, students, and advocates of American Independence—including George Washington—came to the Philosophy Chamber to discover, discuss, and disseminate new knowledge. Students attended lectures and demonstrations there, and visitors from around the globe flocked to the space to see works by some of the Atlantic World’s greatest artists and artisans, including John Singleton Copley and John Trumbull. While the collection survived the Revolutionary War thanks to a temporary relocation (along with all of Harvard College) to Concord, Massachusetts, in 1775, an expansion of the college library in 1820 ultimately led to the dispersal of the collection to various university departments and local museums. _The Philosophy Chamber: Art and Science in Harvard’s Teaching Cabinet, 1766–1820_ reunites many of these original objects, showcasing a range of works that have been hidden away for nearly two centuries. 

The exhibition features more than 100 works displayed in four thematic sections, including a loose reconstruction of the Philosophy Chamber itself. Included are full-length portraits by John Singleton Copley; exceptional examples of Native Hawaiian feather work and carving by indigenous artists of the Northwest Coast; a dazzling, large-scale orrery (a model of the solar system) by Joseph Pope; mezzotints after the work of expatriate American artists; and Stephen Sewall’s mural-sized copy of the Wampanoag inscription on the landmark known as Dighton Rock, an 11-foot boulder located in Berkley, Massachusetts. The objects are drawn from a number of private, academic, and public collections in the United States and the United Kingdom, including from the following collections at Harvard University: the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments, Harvard Art Museums, the Harvard Map Collection, Harvard University Archives, Houghton Library, the Mineralogical and Geological Museum, the Museum of Comparative Zoology, the Peabody Museum of Archaeology & Ethnology, and the Warren Anatomical Museum.

Named for the discipline of natural philosophy, the Philosophy Chamber served as a lecture hall, experimental lab, and picture gallery.

It attests to the wide-ranging spirit of inquiry that characterized the late 18th and early 19th centuries. With an insightful look at conservation efforts and detailed examination of specific objects, including works by artists such as John Singleton Copley and John Trumbull, this publication explores the social and political stakes that underpinned one of the most remarkable assemblages of artifacts, images, and objects in the Atlantic World, and introduces readers to many long-forgotten icons of American culture.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe related exhibition, The Philosophy Chamber: Art and Science in Harvard’s Teaching Cabinet, 1766–1820, is on display at the Harvard Art Museums from May 19 through December 31, 2017.

This transformation is most evident in France, where drawing was significantly, and influentially, repositioned and reconceptualized. This exhibition traces the emergence of the modern understanding of drawing from the 18th through the 19th century in multiple senses: as an autonomous form of expression, an index of the artist’s style, an object of aesthetic contemplation, an epistemological tool, and a commodity. The variety of techniques, materials, and approaches presented here offer a historically complex answer to the basic question: what does it mean to draw?

While historically grounded, the exhibition is not organized chronologically; rather, it is arranged around a constellation of categories that speak to key aspects of drawing. The display is divided into three sections—Medium, Object, Discourse—and, within them, into several subsections that treat the basic procedures of drawings not merely as the means but also as the agents of representation. “Medium” refers to the conjunction of materials and techniques with the historically specific conventions that govern their use in drawing. It explores artists’ interaction with, rather than simply their use of, the material bases of drawings. “Object” addresses the social and cultural functions and uses of drawing, focusing on its role as a tool of artistic instruction, its relation to reproductive technologies, its uses in architecture and decorative design, and its contribution to the production of knowledge. “Discourse” considers drawing as a means of conceptualization as well as a visual mode of thinking in and of itself.

This exhibition is the result of a unique collaboration between Ewa Lajer-Burcharth, the William Dorr Boardman Professor of Fine Arts at Harvard University; Elizabeth M. Rudy, the Carl A. Weyerhaeuser Associate Curator of Prints at the Harvard Art Museums; and the Harvard students who helped develop and organize the exhibition in the context of two seminars taught in the Fall 2015 and Spring 2016 semesters, in the museums’ <a href=""http://www.harvardartmuseums.org/teaching-and-research/art-study-center"">Art Study Center</a>.

The exhibition <a href=""http://shop.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/frontpage/products/drawing-the-invention-of-a-modern-medium"">catalogue</a>, featuring essays by students from the seminar Drawing: Object, Medium, Discourse, is available in the shop early February 2017.

Access the related <a href=""http://www.harvardartmuseums.org/tour/drawing-the-invention-of-a-modern-medium"">digital tool</a> on our website for more information about the works on view, including short entries written by students from the seminar Drawing on the Exhibition and audio commentary.

This project is supported in part by the Gurel Student Exhibition Fund and the Mellon Publication Funds at the Harvard Art Museums.

Students from two seminars co-taught by Ewa Lajer-Burcharth, the William Dorr Boardman Professor of Fine Arts, and Elizabeth M. Rudy, the Carl A. Weyerhaeuser Associate Curator of Prints, were charged with helping organize a curricular exhibition that would illuminate drawing’s emergence into modernity over the 18th and 19th centuries. The project has yielded the exhibition Drawing: The Invention of a Modern Medium (on view at the Harvard Art Museums in the University Research and Teaching Galleries, January 21–May 7, 2017), an accompanying catalogue, and a digital tool.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGraduate students who participated in the Fall 2015 seminar developed a conceptual framework for the exhibition, helped select objects to study within that framework, and wrote the essays that appear in the catalogue. These essays, presented in a non-traditional, non-chronological way, are arranged within three main sections—medium, discourse, object—with several sub-categories under each.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn the Spring 2016 seminar, a group of undergraduates further developed the exhibition by helping finalize the display of objects in the gallery (which mirrors the organization of the catalogue) and by writing object labels for the digital component of the project. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis project is supported in part by the Gurel Student Exhibition Fund and the Mellon Publication Funds at the Harvard Art Museums.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nShare your experience on social media: #DrawingsatHarvard', 'publicationid': 22302, 'title': 'Drawing: The Invention of a Modern Medium', 'primaryimageurl': 'https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:LEG262399', 'publicationdate': '2017'}]"

Evoking themes such as the lasting grief of war, Salcedo’s works honor, acknowledge, and mourn those lost to oppression and political violence in Colombia and beyond. The pieces also address 20th-century preoccupation with materiality and the object; however, Salcedo’s artistic process is distinctive in the way it fuses painstaking research with works fastidiously made by hand.

The Materiality of Mourning features four separate installations, with a number of Salcedo’s works created between 2001 and today. These include the Harvard Art Museums’ recent acquisition, A Flor de Piel (2013), which will be shown publicly for the first time in this exhibition. A room-size tapestry comprised of thousands of preserved hand-sewn red rose petals, the work is intended as a shroud for a nurse who was tortured to death in the Colombian war. 

Additional objects on view include a selection of Salcedo’s seminal sculptures, on loan from private and public collections as well as from the artist herself. Several works incorporate domestic furniture in unsettling configurations. Thou-less (2001–02), for instance, is comprised of carved, stainless steel chairs that are at once familiar and strange. Other works highlight how Salcedo has recently pushed her commitment to materiality and its expressive possibilities to new extremes. These include four works from the Disremembered series, individual ephemeral blouse-like sculptures that are constructed of handwoven silk threads filled with tiny needles. Each Disremembered sculpture provides a spectral contrast to Salcedo’s dense physically imposing works, such as the two Untitled furniture pieces (2008) made of wood, metal, and concrete—with a combined weight of over 1,800 pounds—that will also be shown in the exhibition.

The accompanying illustrated catalogue, published by the Harvard Art Museums and distributed by Yale University Press, draws on more than a decade of research by exhibition curator Mary Schneider Enriquez, who delves into Salcedo’s complex artistic practice, the significance of materiality, and the political context informing her work. An essay by conservation scientist Narayan Khandekar explores the artist’s use of organic and nontraditional materials, particularly with regard to the conservation challenges they pose. The catalogue also includes a contribution from Salcedo herself, reflecting on the philosophical underpinnings of her work and on her decision to remain working in her native Colombia.

Entitled ""_Folding, Refraction, Touch_"":https://hvrd.art/o/352919 (2013), Tillmans’s installation foregrounds, formally and thematically, the material and immaterial qualities of the photographic medium. The 19-part installation, created specifically for the Busch-Reisinger Museum and shown publicly for the first time, is accompanied by 10 works from other artists, including Oskar Nerlinger, Norbert Kricke, and Isa Genzken, whose works resonate with Tillmans’s interest in surface, light, and the body.

In 2015, the museums commissioned Ben Rivers, a 2015–16 Radcliffe-Film Study Center Fellow, to produce a nine-channel installation for the Lightbox Gallery, a space for digital projects that respond to collections and collections data. Rivers, a London-based artist and filmmaker, brought his 16mm camera to the museums and filmed a number of ancient objects that he selected from our collections database. These sculptures are compared here with other forms of making: cave drawings etched into rock that Rivers filmed during recent trips to Nevada and Utah and found footage from an old 16mm educational film, Cave People of Old, that Rivers reprinted, illuminating the film during transfer with a torch light. Framing the nine screens is the voice of poet William Bronk reading his poem “At Tikal,” recorded by the Woodberry Poetry Room at Harvard in 1956.

This installation places objects from ancient Chinese and Byzantine worlds in a false context. But Rivers’s project is not rooted in the discipline of art history. Rather, like the writing of William Bronk, this project articulates the process of making: thinking through what becomes legible and what is frustrated as we translate objects into speculative and charismatic reproductions.

Yet more than these two movements, symbolism sought to evoke ideas subjectively—through color, form, and composition—rather than objectively representing worldly appearances. The title of the show is inspired by Les Fleurs du Mal (1857), an influential collection of poems by Charles Baudelaire, thus alluding to the literary antecedents of the movement.

Symbolist drawings were not united by a single technique or style, but by the artists’ shared desire to make the invisible visible—whether they chose subject, form, or some combination of the two as their major aesthetic focus. Often enigmatic, these graphic works served as signs of a deeper or higher degree of consciousness, beyond the literal objects that they depicted. Symbolism enabled artists to confront an increasingly uncertain and complex world, one that they alternately viewed in terms of degeneration and decadence, idealism and reform.

Featuring 40 drawings, mainly from the permanent collections of the Harvard Art Museums, this exhibition covers some of the major themes of symbolism, such as dreams and visions, spirituality, nature, and the relationship between society and the self. It offers an expansive view, including not only artists who identified themselves as symbolists but also influential precursors, as well as artists active at the end of the movement. The exhibition acknowledges the international nature of symbolism, which was centered in France but extended to countries such as Austria, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, England, and the United States.

Works by the period’s outstanding draftsmen will be on view, including Pieter Bruegel the Elder, Lambert Doomer, Jacques de Gheyn II, Hendrick Goltzius, Jan van Goyen, Maarten van Heemskerck, Rembrandt van Rijn, Peter Paul Rubens, and Cornelis Vroom. The first section, comprised of drawings from the 1500s, highlights the stylistic innovations precipitated by contact with Italian Renaissance models. A second group evokes the imagery propagated by a resurgent Catholic church in the southern Netherlands after the division of the Low Countries into an independent and officially Protestant North (the Dutch Republic) and a Catholic South ruled by regents of the Spanish monarchy. A third group shows the range of subjects and techniques explored in the drawings of Rembrandt and the adaptation of his draftsmanship by some of his pupils and close followers. The emergence of landscape as an autonomous artistic genre is the focus of the fourth section, which includes works by 16th-century precursors of the naturalistic landscape and illustrates several of the types of views depicted by Dutch 17th-century masters. Dutch draftsmen of the 17th century also helped turn portraits and scenes from everyday life into autonomous artistic genres of remarkable variety and sophistication. Drawings in the final section range from poignant studies taken from life to complete compositions rife with humor and layers of meaning that would have delighted and challenged viewers of the period.

This exhibition corresponds to the publication of Drawings from the Age of Bruegel, Rubens, and Rembrandt, which catalogues 100 of the most significant 16th- to 18th-century works from the Netherlandish, Dutch, and Flemish schools in the museums’ collections.

The exhibition showcases more than 70 works drawn from public and private collections in Australia and the United States, and features many works that have never been seen outside Australia. Works by some of the most significant contemporary Indigenous artists will be on view, including Rover Thomas and Emily Kam Kngwarray (both former representatives at the Venice Biennale); Judy Watson, recipient of the 2006 Clemenger Contemporary Art Award; Doreen Reid Nakamarra, who participated in dOCUMENTA (13); Vernon Ah Kee, who has also exhibited at the Venice Biennale, and most recently, the Istanbul Biennial; and the visual and performance artist Christian Thompson, who was recently mentored by Marina Abramović in Australia.

An exhibition of this scope has not been seen in the United States for more than 25 years, and it reflects the ways in which the art historical landscape has shifted since then. Indigenous art is no longer positioned as “other,” but as another form of contemporary art that demands our critical attention. This exhibition presents an opportunity to introduce audiences to the central role that Indigenous art plays in the global narrative of contemporary art.

The analytical laboratory of the Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies at the Harvard Art Museums, a world leader in conservation and conservation science, is also carrying out the first-ever large-scale technical examination of traditional Indigenous bark paintings as part of the exhibition. Understanding the materials used by the artists will provide enormous insights into the long-standing practices and traditions of Indigenous painting.

The exhibition catalogue, published by the Harvard Art Museums and distributed by Yale University Press, includes images of the works on display and six essays by distinguished scholars. The publication delves more deeply into the concepts proposed in the exhibition, offering a lasting look at Indigenous Australian art and paying homage to the particular traditions of specific regions of Australia.

Fascination with Bosch’s paintings ignited the imaginations of artists and viewers alike, giving rise to a distinct group of images inspired by this singular artist. This exhibition, organized by the Saint Louis Art Museum, explores the phenomenon of Bosch’s wide-reaching impact through the print medium from the 16th century to the present. The more than 30 prints on display, mostly from a single private collection, are joined by a selection from the Harvard Art Museums collections, presenting a unique opportunity to view these riveting works. 

The exhibition tells the story of Bosch’s afterlife in the print medium and the profound impact that the burgeoning print market, beginning prominently in mid-16th century Antwerp, had on his posthumous reputation. Although none of the prints are by Bosch, nearly all declare him the “inventor” of their compositions, giving rise to a true Boschian brand. The long tradition of Bosch-inspired prints begins with the master’s contemporary, Alart du Hameel, and continues with artists and entrepreneurs spanning several centuries, including Pieter Bruegel the Elder, Hieronymus Cock, Balthasar van den Bos, Jacques Callot, and M. C. Escher. An animated video by contemporary Belgian artist Antoine Roegiers, The Seven Deadly Sins (2011), will also be shown in the gallery. The video takes its inspiration from a series of drawings by Pieter Bruegel the Elder that were themselves inspired by Bosch.

The exhibition is accompanied by a catalogue published by the Saint Louis Art Museum, which will be available in the Harvard Art Museums shop. Contributors include exhibition curators Marisa Bass (Harvard AM ʼ06, PhD ʼ11), from Washington University in Saint Louis, and Elizabeth Wyckoff, from the Saint Louis Art Museum, as well as Matthijs Ilsink of the Bosch Research and Conservation Project and Peter Fuhring of the Fondation Custodia in Paris.

Beyond Bosch is on display in the museums’ University Research Gallery, a site for curatorial experimentation that encourages a range of faculty engagement, from generating exhibition concepts to evaluating visitor experience. Leading Bosch scholar Joseph Koerner, the Victor S. Thomas Professor of the History of Art and Architecture at Harvard, and Noah Feldman, the Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law at Harvard, are incorporating this exhibition into their course The Enemy: Law and the Human.  

Beyond Bosch: The Afterlife of a Renaissance Master in Print has been organized by the Saint Louis Art Museum (www.slam.org). It was curated by Marisa Bass, assistant professor of art history and archaeology at Washington University in Saint Louis, and Elizabeth Wyckoff, curator of prints, drawings, and photographs at the Saint Louis Art Museum. The Harvard Art Museums’ presentation of Beyond Bosch was curated by Danielle Carrabino, associate research curator in European and American art, and has been made possible in part by support from the Rabb Family Exhibitions Fund and an anonymous gift in memory of Melvin R. Seiden. 

This year marks the 500th anniversary of Bosch's death, and the Harvard Art Museums are one of the first institutions in the world to open an exhibition officially honoring the 2016 milestone.

His work draws attention to the impossibility of the human body to conform to notions of perfection.

In conjunction with his first solo exhibition in the United States, <i>Shahryar Nashat: Skins and Stand-ins</i>, on view October 29, 2015 through January 10, 2016 at Harvard’s Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, the artist has installed works from the museums’ collections in this sculpture gallery. Amid the molded and cast faces and bodies of 20th-century symbolist and expressionist sculpture, visitors are encouraged to sit on the artist’s newly commissioned sculpture-bench <i>Repose on Display</i>. Adapting the ubiquitous forms of museum exhibition display—plinths, pedestals, lighting, and benches—Nashat inserts spectators into the overall installation. Here, the visitor becomes both viewer and performer seated before representations of bodies from the history of art comparably situated on museum display apparatus.

Also known as Sister Mary Corita, Kent is often seen as a curiosity or an anomaly in the pop art movement. Corita Kent and the Language of Pop positions Kent and her work within the pop art idiom, showing how she is an innovative contemporary of Andy Warhol, Edward Ruscha, Roy Lichtenstein, Jim Dine, Robert Indiana, and other pop art icons. The exhibition examines Kent’s screenprints as well as her 1971 bold “rainbow swash” design for the Boston Gas (now National Grid) tank located alongside I-93 south of downtown Boston, claiming it as the city's own pop art monument. More than 60 of Kent’s prints appear alongside about the same number of works by her prominent contemporaries, along with a selection of films, books, and other works.
The exhibition also expands the current scholarship on Kent’s art, elevating the role of her artwork by identifying its place in the artistic and cultural movements of her time. In particular, the exhibition explores how Kent’s work both responded to and advanced the concerns of Vatican II, a movement to modernize the Catholic Church and make it more relevant to contemporary society. The church advocated, among other changes to traditional liturgy, conducting the Mass in English. Kent, like her pop art contemporaries, simultaneously turned to vernacular texts for inclusion in her prints, drawing from such colloquial sources as product slogans, street signs, and Beatles lyrics.
Kent (1918–1986) was a Roman Catholic nun, artist, and teacher. From 1936 to 1968 she lived, studied, and taught at the Immaculate Heart of Mary in Los Angeles, and she headed the art department at the college there from 1964 to 1968. In 1968, Kent left Immaculate Heart and relocated to Boston, where she lived until her death in 1986. 
The exhibition catalogue, published by the Harvard Art Museums and distributed by Yale University Press, offers nearly 90 illustrated entries and four essays by distinguished scholars and fills a gap in the scholarship about Kent’s work. http://shop.harvardartmuseums.org/

This handsomely illustrated catalogue places Kent in her rightful position among the foremost figures of pop art, such as Andy Warhol, Ed Ruscha, and Roy Lichtenstein. Although Kent has been largely excluded from the academic and critical discourses surrounding 1960s American art, this publication reevaluates her importance and highlights how her work questioned and expanded the boundaries of the pop art movement.\r\nFour essays and nearly 90 catalogue entries pull together a variety of topics—art history, religion, politics, linguistics, race, gender, mass media, and advertising—that influenced Kent’s life and work during the 1960s. A roster of eminent pop scholars delve into the relationship between her art and that of her contemporaries, and explore how her art both responded to and advanced the changes in modern-day Catholicism stemming from Vatican II. Over 200 vibrant images showcase Kent’s ingenious screenprints, which often combine handwritten text and commercial imagery.

This marks the first time the installation is presented in its entirety. The installation takes as its point of departure a book also titled Ärztliche Zimmergymnastik (Medicalized Indoor Gymnastics) by German physician Dr. Daniel Gottlob Moritz Schreber (1808–1861). Schreber’s 1858 publication was a popular manual of exercises prescribed for “the maintenance of health and vigor of body and mind.” Green’s installation elegantly and provocatively explores cultural tropes and ideologies of the disciplined body through the lens of modernist art—its operations and its legacies.
Green’s video presents the 45 exercises explained in Schreber’s book, enacted by 16 male performers on wooden platforms arranged as a 4 x 4 grid. The camera documents their movements in a 360-degree tracking shot, which ends at the same moment the performers finish the exercises. A series of photographs that document each of the 45 exercises, drawings, three concrete sculptures, 16 wooden platforms, and a 24-hour backwards-moving clock in homage to Felix Gonzalez-Torres are also included.
Green received his A.B. from Harvard College in 2002 and his M.F.A. from UCLA in 2008. His work has been celebrated with exhibitions around the world, at such institutions as the Tate Modern; the Whitney Museum of American Art; the Institute of Contemporary Art/Boston; the Bologna Museum of Modern Art; the Center for Contemporary Art, in Warsaw; Halle 14, in Leipzig; and many others. He lives and works in Boston.
This installation of Jesse Aron Green’s Ärztliche Zimmergymnastik is curated by John Hulsey, a Ph.D. candidate in Harvard’s Film and Visual Studies Program and a curatorial intern in the Division of Modern and Contemporary Art at the Harvard Art Museums.

This marks the first time the installation is presented in its entirety. The installation takes as its point of departure a book also titled _Ärztliche Zimmergymnastik_ (Medicalized Indoor Gymnastics) by German physician Dr. Daniel Gottlob Moritz Schreber (1808–1861). Schreber’s 1858 publication was a popular manual of exercises prescribed for “the maintenance of health and vigor of body and mind.” Green’s installation elegantly and provocatively explores cultural tropes and ideologies of the disciplined body through the lens of modernist art—its operations and its legacies.

Green’s video presents the 45 exercises explained in Schreber’s book, enacted by 16 male performers on wooden platforms arranged as a 4 x 4 grid. The camera documents their movements in a 360-degree tracking shot, which ends at the same moment the performers finish the exercises. A series of photographs that document each of the 45 exercises, drawings, three concrete sculptures, 16 wooden platforms, and a 24-hour backwards-moving clock in homage to Felix Gonzalez-Torres are also included.

Green received his A.B. from Harvard College in 2002 and his M.F.A. from UCLA in 2008. His work has been celebrated with exhibitions around the world, at such institutions as the Tate Modern; the Whitney Museum of American Art; the Institute of Contemporary Art/Boston; the Bologna Museum of Modern Art; the Center for Contemporary Art, in Warsaw; Halle 14, in Leipzig; and many others. He lives and works in Boston.

This installation of Jesse Aron Green’s _Ärztliche Zimmergymnastik_ is curated by John Hulsey, a Ph.D. candidate in Harvard’s Film and Visual Studies Program and a curatorial intern in the Division of Modern and Contemporary Art at the Harvard Art Museums. The exhibition is made possible by support from the Widgeon Point Charitable Foundation and the José Soriano Fund.
